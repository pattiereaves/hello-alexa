# Make your website talk: How to use WordPress to power an Alexa Skill

In this talk, weâ€™ll walk through setting up an Alexa Skill using the VoiceWP plugin. Participants will learn how to test a skill locally, develop it using the WordPress REST API, and publish the skill to the Alexa marketplace.

Demo an Alexa Skill

What makes a good Alexa skill?
- Something that works for a hands-free moment (e.g. while cooking dinner)
- Something that is triggered by an activity the user is doing (i.e. it's time to feed the dog)
- Something that doesn't take a lot of back and forth with the user (voice interactions are not long)

An overview of how Alexa Skills are engineered using VoiceWP

You configure an API on your server
You configure your skill on Amazon
The user installs your skill on their device
When the user makes a request to the skill, it sends that to your endpoint
You can pass session variables back and forth to the endpoint

Requirements
- Amazon Developer account
- Relatively modern WordPress installation
